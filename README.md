# 🏢 PitchBook Company API: Private Company Data to Structured JSON

> The most efficient, reliable, and developer-friendly way to use the PitchBook Company API.

**Actor page:** [apify.com/johnvc/pitchbook-company-api](https://apify.com/johnvc/pitchbook-company-api?fpr=9n7kx3)
**Input schema:** [apify.com/johnvc/pitchbook-company-api/input-schema](https://apify.com/johnvc/pitchbook-company-api/input-schema?fpr=9n7kx3)

Send one or many public PitchBook company profile URLs and get back one clean JSON row per company: name, industry, employees, founding year, ownership status, funding and deal history, competitors, and investors. It is built API-first and MCP-ready, so you can call it from Python or drive it as a tool from an AI agent.

## Video Walkthrough

[![Watch the walkthrough](https://img.youtube.com/vi/jREWahDGhJM/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jREWahDGhJM)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- An Apify account and API key ([get a free key here](https://apify.com?fpr=9n7kx3))

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnisanerd/Apify-PitchBook-Company-API.git
   cd Apify-PitchBook-Company-API
   ```

2. **Install dependencies with UV**
   ```bash
   # Install UV if you do not have it:
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Install project dependencies:
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Configure your API key**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your Apify API key
   # Get your free API key at: https://apify.com?fpr=9n7kx3
   ```

4. **Run the example**
   ```bash
   uv run python pitchbook-company-api-example.py
   ```

### Alternative: set the API key directly
```bash
export APIFY_API_TOKEN="your_api_key_here"
uv run python pitchbook-company-api-example.py
```

## Why Use This PitchBook Company API?

**A URL in, structured data out.** You never touch collection infrastructure. Pass a public company profile URL and get flat, predictable private-company fields you can load straight into a sheet, a database, or a CRM.

**Batch friendly.** Send up to 1000 company URLs in one run. They are collected in parallel and returned one row each, so enriching a target list is one call.

**Pay per company.** Billing is per company returned, with no per-run setup fee, so you only pay for what is delivered.

**Reliable and predictable.** Every company comes back with the same field shape, and a URL that cannot be collected returns a clear error row instead of failing the whole run.

**MCP-ready.** Call it as a tool from Claude, Cursor, and other AI agents (see the install sections below).

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- Collect one or many public PitchBook company profiles by URL
- Name, industry, employees, founding year, and ownership status
- Funding and deal history: latest deal type, date, and amount, plus financing rounds
- Competitors, verticals, HQ location, named investors, and the PitchBook profile URL

### Data Quality
- One consistent JSON row per company, every time
- A plain-language `summary` field on every row for quick scanning and AI use
- Clear per-URL error rows so a single bad link never sinks the batch

## Usage Examples

### Basic Example
```json
{
  "companyUrls": ["https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/10874-98"]
}
```

### Batch Example (collected in parallel)
```json
{
  "companyUrls": [
    "https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/10874-98",
    "https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/521432-65"
  ]
}
```

## Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `companyUrls` | `list[str]` | YES | - | One or more public PitchBook `/profiles/company/` page URLs. Up to 1000 per run; non-profile URLs are skipped. |

## Output Format

Each company is returned as one JSON row:

```json
{
  "result_type": "company",
  "name": "Automic Software",
  "pitchbookId": "10874-98",
  "description": "Developer of an automation software platform created to help companies automate tasks across various apps and servers.",
  "website": "www.automic.com",
  "hqLocation": "Am Europlatz 5, Vienna, 1120, Austria",
  "primaryIndustry": "Business/Productivity Software",
  "verticals": ["CloudTech & DevOps", "SaaS", "TMT"],
  "employees": 600,
  "foundedYear": 1985,
  "status": "Acquired/Merged",
  "ownershipStatus": "Acquired/Merged",
  "financingStatus": "Formerly PE-Backed",
  "acquirer": "CA Technologies",
  "latestDealType": "M&A",
  "financingRounds": 6,
  "investmentsCount": 6,
  "competitors": ["Chef Software", "Worksoft", "Puppet"],

  "summary": "Automic Software, Business/Productivity Software, 600 employees, founded 1985, Acquired/Merged"
}
```

The `acquirer`, `competitors`, and deal fields are returned when the profile lists them.

## Install in Claude Cowork Desktop

![Install in Claude Cowork Desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnisanerd/ApifyPublicData/main/assets/guides/install_mcp_into_claude_desktop.png)

Cowork is the desktop app's automation mode. To give it the PitchBook Company API as a tool, add the Apify MCP server as a connector.

1. Open the Claude desktop app and go to **Settings → Connectors** (or **Settings → Developer → Edit Config** to edit `claude_desktop_config.json` directly).
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Add the Apify MCP server, preloaded with only this Actor:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apify": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,johnvc/pitchbook-company-api"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart the app. When Cowork first calls the tool, complete the OAuth prompt in your browser, or add your Apify API token in the connector settings to skip OAuth.
4. In a Cowork chat, confirm the tool is available and ask it to run the PitchBook Company API.

## Install in Claude Code

![Install in Claude Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnisanerd/ApifyPublicData/main/assets/guides/install_mcp_into_claude_code.png)

Claude Code is the command-line tool. Add the Actor's MCP server with one command:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http apify \
  "https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,johnvc/pitchbook-company-api"
```

To use a token instead of browser OAuth:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http apify \
  "https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,johnvc/pitchbook-company-api" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN"
```

Then verify with `claude mcp list`, or run `/mcp` inside a session. Ask Claude Code to call the PitchBook Company API.

## Install in Claude (website)

![Install in Claude (website)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnisanerd/ApifyPublicData/main/assets/guides/install_mcp_into_claude_ai.png)

On claude.ai you add Apify as a connector, then enable just this Actor's tool.

2. When connecting, authenticate with your Apify API token, and enable the tool `johnvc/pitchbook-company-api`.
3. In any chat, open **+ → Connectors** and turn on **Apify**.
4. Alternatively, choose **Add custom connector** and paste the full MCP URL `https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,johnvc/pitchbook-company-api`, using OAuth when prompted.
5. Ask Claude to run the PitchBook Company API.

Open Claude on the web: https://claude.ai/referral/uIlpa7nPLg

## Install in Cursor

![Install in Cursor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnisanerd/ApifyPublicData/main/assets/guides/install_mcp_into_cursor.png)

Cursor reads MCP servers from a project file at `.cursor/mcp.json`.

1. In your project, create `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apify": {
      "url": "https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,johnvc/pitchbook-company-api"
    }
  }
}
```

2. If you prefer token auth over browser OAuth, add a header:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apify": {
      "url": "https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=actors,docs,johnvc/pitchbook-company-api",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN" }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Open **Cursor → Settings → MCP** and confirm the **apify** server is connected (green dot).
4. In Composer or Chat, ask Cursor to call the PitchBook Company API.
